flac-itunes-import-service--macos-
==================================

applescript script as one click service to import flac into iTunes library 
(while converting to apple's aif, apple loss less, aac, mp3 or wav)

The script is not developed by me, but after struggling finding elega…
…nt solution I found this in deeps of googles results.

The last message in the forum was 2005, so I decided rather keep this in live.

This Apple script can be easily copied into Automator, saved as folder service,
install into ~/Library/Services and we can import on right click on file or folder.

(prerequisite is install flac until - I found and installed from macports - just 
changed the paths at line 29 and 30) that's it.

Many thanks to original author
